# Stock Management System: A microservice practice

## Introduction

This is my final homework of intro to software engineering
when I was freshman in undergraduate university. I still
remember the cooperation of my two friends and me.

This is a Spring Cloud project and we docklized them and
deployed them on Alibaba Cloud, which is similar to AWS.
